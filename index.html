    <p class="story-text has-dropcap">
      <span class="dropcap">I</span>n the weeks before her sentencing for crimes against humanity in November, Sheikh
      Hasina set out to remake her image. From exile in India, the ousted prime minister gave a string of emailed
      interviews to international outlets, striking a careful, even conciliatory tone. She spoke of justice “for all”,
      mourned “each life lost” under her watch, and warned against deepening “division” in Bangladesh. In one interview,
      she went so far as to appeal for national healing.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Off script, however, a radically different Hasina was speaking. In impromptu phone calls to party activists where
      no public relations team was shaping her words, she urged revenge, called for homes to be burned in retaliation,
      pressed for guerrilla-style armed retribution, and scolded supporters for not retaliating with violence. In one
      recording, she even asked why the Bangladeshi army was not rolling out tanks to overthrow the interim government
      that replaced her.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      In English, Hasina cast herself as a liberal democrat committed to justice and restraint. In Bengali, speaking to
      loyalists, she demanded “an eye for an eye”, even invoking Quranic verses to justify her incitement.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      At Netra News’s request, Tech Global Institute (TGI) carried out an independent open-source forensic assessment of
      all but one publicly available audio clips, finding no conclusive evidence of material manipulation.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Although the files lacked metadata and other forensic signals, the group found no clear or detectable artefacts
      consistent with artificial-intelligence-generated manipulation or significant audio splicing. A separate analysis
      using voice-consistency metrics found 15 clips showed a higher likelihood of consistency with Sheikh Hasina’s
      known voice, while the remaining three were lower-confidence clips, as ambient noise signals reduced attribution
      confidence.

    </p>


    <p class="story-text">
      As these calls spread, Bangladesh slid into renewed turmoil. In the days before Hasina’s sentencing by the
      International Crimes Tribunal — which later imposed the death penalty after a trial in absentia — arson attacks
      and crude bombings targeted public transport and the homes of interim government officials. On December 12th, a
      firebrand student leader, Osman Hadi, was shot in what investigators believe was a targeted political killing by
      Awami League activists, a kind of assassination Bangladesh has not seen in decades.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Political violence is hardly new in Bangladesh, and parties almost always deny responsibility. This time, the
      Awami League did not. Nor did Hasina’s family. Her son, Sajeeb Wazed, warned Reuters that excluding the party from
      upcoming elections would lead to more bloodshed. “If these elections are allowed to go ahead, then Bangladesh
      becomes another failed state,” he told Marya Shakil of India Today in November, as if issuing a threat. “With the
      Awami League constantly protesting, it will turn into violence, and it will be an unstable country.”
    </p>

    <h2>Eye for an eye</h2>

    <p class="story-text">
      Hasina’s most visceral appeals came not long after her flight to India, leaving behind a death toll estimated at
      between 700 and 1,400.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Just two months into her exile, Jahangir Alam, a former local official in northern Bangladesh, called her to say
      his home had been torched, allegedly by supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami, both
      Hasina’s nemesis.
    </p>


    <p class="story-text">
      “Do they not have homes of their own? So? Must everything be done out in the open?” she snapped.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      “If your homes can be destroyed, so can theirs,” she went on. “If they burn my house, I won’t hesitate to burn
      theirs.” Alam agreed.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      By October that year, criminal complaints accusing Hasina of ordering the excessive use of force had piled up. “I
      have 227 murder complaints against me across the country,” she told Alam. “So I’ve asked everyone: make a list.
      You, too, should make a list — because I’ve got the licence to kill at least 227.” (The recording was rated low on
      the voice consistency scale by the independent researchers, though the analysis found no signs of AI-based
      manipulation.)
    </p>


    <p class="story-text">
      She pushed the point further. “Whether it’s one murder or two and a quarter hundred, the punishment is the same,
      isn’t it? So let it be. I’ll face what comes. But before that, I’ll mark off each of those two and a quarter
      hundred.”
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      In at least three other recordings posted on Facebook and YouTube in October, Hasina promised her supporters that
      she would settle her political accounts.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      “I will settle the score one by one,” she said in one call. “They will harm my activists time and again — and will
      I just stand by and watch? No.”
    </p>



    <p class="story-text">
      “I’ll clean it out this time,” she added. “My aim now is to clean away the filth. I will clean the filth of
      Bangladesh.”
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      In another virtual speech made public in September, she warned, “They must be let know, ‘if you touch fire, your
      hands will burn’.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Yet, none of this fury appeared in her international interviews. Writing to The Independent, for example, she said
      she “mourns each and every child, sibling, cousin and friend we lost as a nation” and urged Bangladesh to “heal”.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Rather than discouraging violence, she argued for it. In another September call, addressing activists who appeared
      hesitant, she asked: “So why wait to regain power and then take revenge or get justice through the law? When they
      have seized power illegally, what is there left to think about with them at all?”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      She then escalated. “Why do you forget that Bangladesh won its freedom through guerrilla war? You must take that
      same path. Those responsible — wherever they are, however you find them — act immediately.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      In another call, Hasina was even more explicit about what she expected from her party.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      “The one who burns your house has his house intact — why?” she said in another call. “Why this weakness? This
      country has been liberated through guerrilla warfare. You better remember it.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      There are signs her wishes were fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Before the verdict against her was announced, a wave of targeted arson followed during a transport strike that she
      asked her loyalists to enforce. The strike saw the targeting of public buses, buildings, and the homes of
      officials. Arson attacks on buses in Mymensingh and Manikganj burned two drivers alive.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Such violence during political strikes is not uncommon in Bangladesh, and parties typically deny responsibility
      and condemn it. In this case, the Awami League did not — even as the interim government accused it of stoking the
      unrest.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      In a speech in June, she again urged party members to wage “guerrilla warfare” against their own country.
      “Bangladesh was liberated by guerrilla warfare. So teach them a lesson, in whatever way possible. This is my
      order,” she said in a virtual address.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Netra News identified at least three separate instances in which Hasina invoked guerrilla war.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Her subordinates appeared to grasp her meaning. A minister from her cabinet told Russia’s state-run RT: “Awami
      League will launch a war like the Liberation War through which we liberated Bangladesh.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">THE AWAMI LEAGUE FACEBOOK PAGE POSTER</p>
    <p class="story-text">On at least two occasions, Hasina also cited the Quran to justify violent revenge. In the
      November speech, where she referred to “guerrilla warfare”, she said: “To put simply, a hand for a hand, and an
      eye for an eye. That’s been set out in the Quran.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">In an earlier call in October, she made the same argument. “An eye for an eye, a hand for a
      hand — keeping in mind the Quran, you will take action with whatever you have,” she concluded.</p>
    <p class="story-text">She also appeared, more than once, to prod the military, an institution with a steroid history
      of coups. Recalling that tanks had once been used to kill members of her family, she questioned why they were not
      now being used to unseat the interim government. “[The tanks] were used to kill us,” she said. “But they can’t
      seem to use them now.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">After prosecutors at the International Crimes Tribunal — the same court that later sentenced
      her to death — charged dozens of current and former military officials over enforced disappearances and killings
      during her rule, Hasina mocked the armed forces for allowing the cases to proceed.</p>
    <p class="story-text">“How dare they issue a warrant against these officers? I want to ask, ‘Where did they find the
      audacity to do this?’” she asked in an address posted to Facebook on October 18th 2025.</p>
    <p class="story-text">In another recording, she complained that the trials of these officers were unfair because
      they had merely followed orders. “Today, 28 or 29 people from the armed forces have cases filed against them,” she
      said. “They will be punished. Why? They have obeyed the orders from above.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">She went on to taunt the military for tolerating the legal process. “Has the army lost its
      strength? Can they not get them and take them away? Then they would’ve gotten an answer.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">After Osman Hadi, the anti-Hasina student leader, was shot dead, surveillance footage released
      by authorities suggested the involvement of individuals linked to the Awami League. Referring to the explosion of
      protests that followed, Hasina remarked almost admittedly: “They can’t seem to bear the weight of just one death.”
