      <span class="dropcap">I</span>n the weeks before her sentencing for crimes against humanity on November 17th 2025,
      Sheikh
      Hasina set out to remake her image. From exile in India, the ousted prime minister gave a string of emailed
      interviews to international outlets, striking a careful, even conciliatory tone. She spoke of justice “for all”,
      mourned “each life lost” under her watch, and warned against deepening “division” in Bangladesh. In one interview,
      she went so far as to appeal for national healing.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Off script, however, a radically different Hasina was speaking. In impromptu phone calls to party activists where
      no public relations team was shaping her words, she urged revenge, called for homes to be burned in retaliation,
      pressed for guerrilla-style armed retribution, and scolded supporters for not retaliating with violence. In one
      recording, she even asked why the Bangladeshi army was not rolling out tanks to overthrow the interim government
      that replaced her.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      In English, Hasina cast herself as a liberal democrat committed to justice and restraint. In Bengali, speaking to
      loyalists, she demanded “an eye for an eye”, even invoking Quranic verses to justify her incitement.

          <br>

    <p class="story-text">
      Netra News reviewed more than two dozen of the call recordings, which show a leader who sounds embittered, aggrieved and
      increasingly desperate, casting herself as a victim entitled to retribution. Circulated openly in short clips for
      more than a year among
      Awami League supporters, the recordings amounted to unambiguous calls for violence. What is striking is not only
      the brazenness of those appeals, but the degree of tolerance shown by her Indian hosts, who have continued to
      speak publicly of “peace and stability” in Bangladesh.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Hasina’s UK-based PR firm, Palatine, and an Awami League spokesperson in India did not respond to requests for
      comment or questions about the recordings’ authenticity. India’s Ministry of External Affairs also did not respond
      to a request for comment.

    <p class="story-text">
      At Netra News’ request, Tech Global Institute (TGI) carried out an independent open-source forensic assessment of
      all but one publicly available audio clips, finding no conclusive evidence of material manipulation.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Although the files lacked metadata and other forensic markers that would normally help verify authenticity, the
      group found no clear signs of artificial intelligence-generated manipulation or significant audio editing. In a
      separate voice-comparison analysis, researchers found that 15 clips closely matched Hasina’s known voice. The
      remaining three were rated lower because background noise made attribution less certain.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      As these calls spread, Bangladesh slid into renewed turmoil. In the days before Hasina’s sentencing by the
      International Crimes Tribunal — which later imposed the death penalty after a trial in absentia — arson attacks
      and crude bombings targeted public transport and the homes of interim government officials. On December 12th, a
      firebrand student leader, Osman Hadi, was shot in what investigators believe was a targeted political killing by
      Awami League activists, a kind of assassination Bangladesh has not seen in decades.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Political violence is hardly new in Bangladesh, and parties almost always deny responsibility. This time, the
      Awami League did not. Nor did Hasina’s family. Her son, Sajeeb Wazed, warned Reuters that excluding the party from
      upcoming elections would lead to more bloodshed. “If these elections are allowed to go ahead, then Bangladesh
      becomes another failed state,” he told Marya Shakil of India Today in November, as if issuing a threat. “With the
      Awami League constantly protesting, it will turn into violence, and it will be an unstable country.”
    </p>
    <h2>License to kill</h2>
    <p class="story-text">
      Hasina’s most visceral appeals came not long after her flight to India, leaving behind a death toll estimated at
      between 700 and 1,400.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Just two months into her exile, Jahangir Alam, a former local official in northern Bangladesh, called her to say
      his home had been torched, allegedly by supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami, both
      Hasina’s nemesis.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      “Do they not have homes of their own? So? Must everything be done out in the open?” she snapped.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      “If your homes can be destroyed, so can theirs,” she went on. “If they burn my house, I won’t hesitate to burn
      theirs.” Alam agreed.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      By October that year, criminal complaints accusing Hasina of ordering the excessive use of force had piled up. “I
      have 227 murder complaints against me across the country,” she told Alam. “So I’ve asked everyone: make a list.
      You, too, should make a list — because I’ve got the licence to kill at least 227.”
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      The recording was rated lower in a voice-comparison analysis by independent researchers, though they found no
      evidence of AI-based manipulation. A separate forensic examination by the police’s Criminal Investigation
      Department concluded that the recording was Sheikh Hasina’s and submitted that finding to a court, according to a
      copy obtained by Netra News.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      In the same recording, she pushed the point further. “Whether it’s one murder or two and a quarter hundred, the
      punishment is the same,
      isn’t it? So let it be. I’ll face what comes. But before that, I’ll mark off each of those two and a quarter
      hundred.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      She advanced a similar argument in another call, suggesting that the banning of the Awami League and its
      affiliated organisations somehow shielded the party from responsibility for any acts of subversion carried out in
      its name.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      “Our activities are now banned, so we no longer have a party,” she said. “Those who support the BNP and Jamaat
      must be attacked. They must be killed. I see no other option. You will have to do it. The Awami League bears no
      responsibility because the Awami League does not exist; the Chhatra League does not exist. We can do whatever we
      want. So do whatever you want. Start now.”
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      In at least three other recordings posted on Facebook and YouTube in October, Hasina promised her supporters that
      she would settle her political accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      “I will settle the score one by one,” she said in one call. “They will harm my activists time and again — and will
      I just stand by and watch? No.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      “I’ll clean it out this time,” she added. “My aim now is to clean away the filth. I will clean the filth of
      Bangladesh.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      In another virtual speech made public in September, she warned, “They must be shown, ‘If you touch fire, your
      hands will burn’.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Yet, none of this fury appeared in her international interviews. Writing to <i>The Independent</i>, for example,
      she said
      she “mourns each and every child, sibling, cousin and friend we lost as a nation” and urged Bangladesh to “heal”.
      In a simultaneous interview with the Agence France Presse, she said her priority was “the welfare and stability of
      Bangladesh.” To Reuters, she cast her crusade as “not about me or my family” but “for Bangladesh to achieve the
      future we all want.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Rather than discouraging violence, she argued for it. In another September call, addressing activists who appeared
      hesitant, she asked: “So why wait to regain power and then take revenge or get justice through the law? When they
      have seized power illegally, what is there left to think about with them at all?”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      She then took things a step further: “Why do you forget that Bangladesh won its freedom through guerrilla war? You
      must take that
      same path. Those responsible — wherever they are, however you find them — take immediate action [against them].”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      In another call, Hasina was even more explicit about what she expected from her party.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      “The one who burns your house has his house intact — why?” she said in another call. “Why this weakness? This
      country has been liberated through guerrilla warfare. You better remember it.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      When an activist promised to take up arms to kill those who had supposedly targeted fellow Awami Leaguers, Hasina
      cut in — not to object to the violence itself, but because she thought he was overpromising. “Talk less. Those who
      talk too much can’t get things done. So talk less, work more. Alright? Don’t say it out loud. Do it first, then
      show that it’s been done. Alright?” she said.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      There are signs her wishes were fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Before the verdict against her was announced, a wave of targeted arson followed during a transport strike that she
      asked her loyalists to enforce. The strike saw the targeting of public buses, buildings, and the homes of
      officials. Arson attacks on buses in Mymensingh and Manikganj burned two drivers alive.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Such violence during political strikes is not uncommon in Bangladesh, and parties typically deny responsibility
      and condemn it. In this case, the Awami League did not — even as the interim government accused it of stoking the
      unrest.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      In a speech in June, she again urged party members to wage “guerrilla warfare” against their own country.
      “Bangladesh was liberated by guerrilla warfare. So teach them a lesson, in whatever way possible. This is my
      order,” she said in a virtual address.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Netra News identified at least three separate instances in which Hasina invoked guerrilla war.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Her subordinates appeared to grasp her meaning. A minister from her cabinet told Russia’s state-run RT: “Awami
      League will launch a war like the Liberation War through which we liberated Bangladesh.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">THE AWAMI LEAGUE FACEBOOK PAGE POSTER</p>
    <p class="story-text">Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971 was initially fought through guerilla warfare against the
      Pakistani military, with freedom fighters sheltered in neighbouring India, under the political leadership of the
      Awami League party. Today, the party — now banned in the country it helped found and operating from refuge in
      India — repeatedly invokes that history. But any attempt to replicate it would not mean a defence against foreign
      occupiers but a war on fellow Bangladeshis.</p>

    <p class="story-text">On at least two occasions, Hasina also cited the Quran to justify violent revenge. In the
      November speech, where she referred to “guerrilla warfare”, she said: “To put simply, a hand for a hand, and an
      eye for an eye. That’s been set out in the Quran.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">In an earlier call in October, she made the same argument. “An eye for an eye, a hand for a
      hand — keeping in mind the Quran, you will take action with whatever you have,” she concluded.</p>
    <p class="story-text">She also appeared, more than once, to prod the military, an institution with a steroid history
      of coups. Recalling that tanks had once been used to kill members of her family, she questioned why they were not
      now being used to unseat the interim government. “[The tanks] were used to kill us,” she said. “But they can’t
      seem to use them now.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">After prosecutors at the International Crimes Tribunal — the same court that later sentenced
      her to death — charged dozens of current and former military officials over enforced disappearances and killings
      during her rule, Hasina mocked the armed forces for allowing the cases to proceed.</p>
    <p class="story-text">“How dare they issue a warrant against these officers? I want to ask, ‘Where did they find the
      audacity to do this?’” she asked in an address posted to Facebook on October 18th 2025.</p>
    <p class="story-text">In another recording, she complained that the trials of these officers were unfair because
      they had merely followed orders. “Today, 28 or 29 people from the armed forces have cases filed against them,” she
      said. “They will be punished. Why? They have obeyed the orders from above.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">She went on to taunt the military for tolerating the legal process. “Has the army lost its
      strength? Can they not get them and take them away? Then they would’ve gotten an answer.”</p>
    <p class="story-text">After Osman Hadi, the anti-Hasina student leader, was shot dead, surveillance footage released
      by authorities suggested the involvement of individuals linked to the Awami League. Referring to the explosion of
      protests that followed, Hasina remarked almost admittedly: “They can’t seem to bear the weight of just one death.”
