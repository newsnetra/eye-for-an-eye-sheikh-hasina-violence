      <span class="dropcap">F</span>ollowing her fall in a mass uprising in 2024, Sheikh Hasina continues to call for revenge as her
        supporters claim they have fallen victim to violence in Bangladesh.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Sheikh Hasina, who has recently been <span class="redacted-reveal">sentenced to death</span> for her command
      responsibilities over the crimes against humanity committed during the 2024 Bangladesh uprising, has been urging
      her supporters to seek revenge, <span class="redacted-reveal">burn down the houses</span> of her political
      opponents and instigating the military to use the tanks like they used in 1975, according to the phone
      conversations with her followers that are making rounds on social media after being leaked.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      These candid messages from the deposed prime minister, delivered in Bengali—the native language of most
      Bangladeshis—stood in stark contrast to the carefully crafted interviews that public relations experts had
      polished before they were published in global news outlets. In those interviews, she presented herself as an
      empathetic exiled liberal democrat advocating for justice; in contrast, when speaking to her supporters, she urged
      them to <span class="redacted-reveal">give a befitting reply</span> to the alleged assaults by her political
      rivals.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Her targets include the alleged victims of her decade-long crackdown who filed cases against her in the courts
      after her fall, the members of the political parties who have been harassing her party’s supporters since August
      2024 and the cabinet of the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, who took over the charge after she left for
      India. The deposed prime minister has been living in India since then.

      Sheikh Hasina and her party, the Awami League, ruled Bangladesh from January 2009 until August 5, 2024. Critics of
      her administration allege that Bangladesh devolved into a “personalised autocracy,” during which over two and a
      half thousand people were killed in staged crossfires, and several hundred, predominantly opposition party
      members, went missing.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      Sheikh Hasina vowed revenge against the plaintiffs. In a conversation with Jahangir Alam, a leader from her party
      in the Gobindganj area of northern Bangladesh, which was leaked just two months after her downfall in October
      2024, she told Alam that she had ordered to prepare a list of the 227 individuals who filed the cases against her
      to murder them. She stated, <span class="redacted-reveal">“I got the license to kill at least 227.”</span>

      Following the fall of the regime, hundreds of Awami League supporters, many of whom were allegedly involved in
      suppressing dissenters for years, were subjected to revenge attacks by their rivals. The leader of the Awami

      In at least three recordings, posted on Facebook and YouTube, Sheikh Hasina was found instructing her party men to
