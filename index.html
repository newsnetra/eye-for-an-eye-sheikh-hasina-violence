    <p class="story-text has-dropcap">
      <span class="dropcap">I</span>n the weeks before her sentencing for crimes against humanity on November 17th 2025,
      Sheikh Hasina set out to remake her image. From exile in India, the ousted prime minister gave a string of emailed
      interviews to international outlets, striking a careful, even conciliatory tone. She spoke of justice “for all”,
      mourned “each life lost” under her watch, and warned against deepening “division” in Bangladesh. In one interview,
      she went so far as to appeal for national healing.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Off script, however, a radically different Hasina was speaking. In impromptu phone calls to party activists where
      no public relations team was shaping her words, she urged revenge, called for homes to be burned in retaliation,
      pressed for guerrilla-style armed retribution, and scolded supporters for not retaliating with violence. In one
      recording, she even asked why the Bangladeshi army was not rolling out tanks after a court initiated proceedings
      against some of its officers for gross human rights abuses.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      In English, Hasina cast herself as a liberal democrat committed to justice and restraint. In Bengali, speaking to
      loyalists, she demanded “an eye for an eye”, even invoking Quranic verses to justify her incitement.
    </p>


    <p class="story-text">
      Netra News reviewed more than two dozen of the call recordings, which show a leader who sounds embittered,
      aggrieved and increasingly desperate, casting herself as a victim entitled to retribution. Circulated openly in
      short clips for more than a year among Awami League supporters, the recordings amounted to unambiguous calls for
      violence. What is striking is not only the brazenness of those appeals, but the degree of tolerance shown by her
      Indian hosts, who have continued to speak publicly of “peace and stability” in Bangladesh.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Hasina’s UK-based PR firm, Palatine, and an Awami League spokesperson in India did not respond to requests for
      comment or questions about the recordings’ authenticity. India’s Ministry of External Affairs also did not respond
      to a request for comment.

    <p class="story-text">
      At Netra News’ request, Tech Global Institute (TGI) carried out an independent open-source forensic assessment of
      all but one publicly available audio clips, finding no conclusive evidence of material manipulation.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Although the files lacked metadata and other forensic markers that would normally help verify authenticity, the
      group found no clear signs of artificial intelligence-generated manipulation or significant audio editing. In a
      separate voice-comparison analysis, researchers found that 15 clips closely matched Hasina’s known voice. The
      remaining three were rated lower because background noise made attribution less certain.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      As these calls spread, Bangladesh slid into renewed turmoil. In the days before Hasina’s sentencing by the
      International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) — which later imposed the death penalty after a trial in absentia — arson
      attacks and crude bombings targeted public transport and the homes of interim government officials. On December
      12th, a firebrand student leader, Osman Hadi, was shot in what investigators believe was a targeted political
      killing by Awami League activists, a kind of assassination Bangladesh has not seen in decades.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Political violence is hardly new in Bangladesh, and parties almost always deny responsibility. This time, the
      Awami League did not. If anything, it’s promising more. Hasina’s US-based son and likely heir-apparent, Sajeeb
      Wazed, warned Reuters that excluding the party from upcoming elections would lead to more bloodshed. “If these
      elections are allowed to go ahead, then Bangladesh becomes another failed state,” he told India Today in November,
      as if issuing a threat. “With the Awami League constantly protesting, it will turn into violence, and it will be
      an unstable country.”
    </p>
    <h2>License to kill</h2>
    <p class="story-text">
      Hasina’s most visceral appeals came not long after her flight to India, leaving behind a death toll estimated at
      between 700 and 1,400.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Just two months into her exile in August 2024, Jahangir Alam, a former local official in northern Bangladesh,
      called her to say his home had been torched, allegedly by supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and
      Jamaat-e-Islami, both Hasina’s nemesis.

      “If your homes can be destroyed, so can theirs,” she went on. “If they burn my house, I won’t hesitate to burn
      theirs.”
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Alam agreed.</p>

      She advanced a similar argument in another call, suggesting that the banning of the Awami League and its

    <p class="story-text">
      Yet, none of this fury appeared in her international interviews. Writing to <a

            style="font-weight: 400;">The Independent</em></a>, for example, she said she &ldquo;mourns each and every
      child, sibling, cousin and friend we lost as a nation&rdquo; and urged Bangladesh to &ldquo;heal&rdquo;. In a
      contemporaneous <a

      with Agence France-Presse, she said her priority was &ldquo;the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.&rdquo;
      Speaking to Reuters, she <a

      Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      In the recordings reviewed, Hasina not only failed to discourage violence, but she argued for it. In a September
      2025 call, addressing activists who appeared hesitant, she asked:
      <span class="inline-trigger audio-trigger" data-src="./assets/audio-excerpts/Call 11 (Dont wait).mp3">
        <span class="inline-icon" aria-hidden="true">

        <span class="highlight-text target-text">
          <span class="karaoke-scope"> “Why wait to regain power and then take
            revenge or get justice through the courts? When they have seized power illegally, what is there left to
            think

        </span>

        <audio preload="none"></audio>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      She then took things a step further:

        <span class="inline-icon" aria-hidden="true">

        <span class="highlight-text target-text">
          <span class="karaoke-scope">“Why do you forget that Bangladesh won its freedom through guerrilla war? You
            must take that
            same path. Those responsible — wherever they are, however you find them — take immediate action [against
            them].”</span>
        </span>

        <audio preload="none"></audio>
      </span>
    </p>


    <p class="story-text">
      In another call, Hasina was even more explicit about what she expected from her party.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      <span class="inline-trigger audio-trigger" data-src="./assets/audio-excerpts/Call 13 (Remember-guerrilla).mp3">

          <span class="karaoke-scope">“The one who burns your house has his house intact — why?”</span> she asked her
          loyalists.

            country has been liberated through guerrilla warfare. You better remember it.”</span>
        </span>

        <audio preload="none"></audio>
      </span>
    </p>


    <p class="story-text">
      When an activist promised to take up arms to kill those who had supposedly targeted fellow Awami Leaguers, Hasina
      cut in — not to object to the violence itself, but because she thought he was overpromising.
      <span class="inline-trigger audio-trigger" data-src="./assets/audio-excerpts/Call 17.mp3">

        <span class="highlight-text target-text">When the activist wished to kill people, she responded:
          <span class="karaoke-scope">“Talk less. Those who
            talk too much can’t get things done. So talk less, work more. Alright? Don’t say it out loud. Do it first,
            then
            show that it’s been done. Alright?”</span>
        </span>

    <p class="story-text">
      There are signs her wishes were fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Before the verdict against her was announced, a wave of targeted arson followed during a transport strike that she
      asked her loyalists to enforce. The strike saw the targeting of public buses, buildings, and the homes of
      officials. Arson attacks on buses in Mymensingh and Manikganj burned two drivers alive.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      Such violence during political strikes is not uncommon in Bangladesh, and parties typically deny responsibility
      and condemn it. In this case, the Awami League did not — even as the interim government accused it of stoking the
      unrest.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      In a speech in June last year, she again urged party members to wage “guerrilla warfare” against their own
      country.
      <span class="inline-trigger audio-trigger" data-src="./assets/audio-excerpts/Call 10 (Guerrilla-Order).mp3">
        <span class="inline-icon" aria-hidden="true">
          <span class="icon icon-play"></span>
          <span class="icon icon-pause"></span>
        </span>

        <span class="highlight-text target-text">
          <span class="karaoke-scope">“Bangladesh was liberated through a guerrilla war. So teach them a lesson, in
            whatever way possible. This is
            my order,”</span> she said in a virtual address.

        </span>

        <audio preload="none"></audio>
      </span>
    </p>


    <p class="story-text">
      Netra News identified at least three separate instances in which Hasina invoked guerrilla war, and her
      subordinates appeared to grasp her meaning.
    </p>
    <p class="story-text">
      A minister from her cabinet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1243093180959104" rel="nofollow">said</a> at a
      virtual address: “If needed, the Awami League will launch a war like the
      Liberation War through which we liberated Bangladesh.”
      “Awami League won’t give up,” he said. “If we’re left with no other route, we will have to prepare to walk toward
      a second liberation war.”</p>


    <p class="story-text">A <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106100805/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fawamileague.1949%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0BNZz756DvZNs6vq9Kdmw57gYgY1yTC1pSy5Mi39YAWRQ2PkEE8teDTjqnHkYAhS8l">photo</a>
      published on the party’s official Facebook page on November 17th 2025, the day of
      Hasina’s sentencing, echoed a similar messaging. “Crores of activists are
      ready. There will be a war again,” the photo read.</p>
    <p class="story-text">Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971 was initially fought through guerilla warfare against the
      Pakistani military, with freedom fighters sheltered in neighbouring India, under the political leadership of the
      Awami League party. Today, the party — now banned in the country it helped found and operating from refuge in
      India — repeatedly invokes that history. But any attempt to replicate it would not mean a defence against foreign
      occupiers but a war on fellow Bangladeshis.</p>

    <p class="story-text">
      On at least two occasions, Hasina also cited the Quran to justify violent revenge. In the
      November 2025 speech, where she referred to “guerrilla warfare”, she said:
      <span class="inline-trigger audio-trigger" data-src="./assets/audio-excerpts/Call 14 (Eye for an eye).mp3">

        <audio preload="none"></audio>
      </span>

    <p class="story-text">
      In an earlier call in October that year, she made the same argument.

          she added, in

    <p class="story-text">After prosecutors at the International Crimes Tribunal — the same court that later sentenced
      her to death — charged dozens of current and former military officials over enforced disappearances and killings
      during her rule, Hasina mocked the armed forces for allowing the cases to proceed.</p>
